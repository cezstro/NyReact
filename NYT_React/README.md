# Overview

In this activity, I created a React-based rendition of the New York Times Article Search application. This assignment required me to create React components, work with helper functions, and utilize the React mounting lifecycle to query and display articles based on user searches. I also used Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save articles to read later.
